## Comparison: NASDAQ-100 vs. DJIA

### NASDAQ-100 Advantages:
1. **Higher Peak Returns:** Top NASDAQ-100 stock (ENPH: +3.61%) vs. Top DJIA (AAPL: +2.00%)
2. **More Extreme Winners:** 6 stocks >2.0% median vs. 3 in DJIA
3. **Technology Concentration:** 60%+ tech exposure vs. ~25% in DJIA
4. **Growth Orientation:** NASDAQ stocks benefit more from consumer optimism

### DJIA Advantages:
1. **Lower Volatility:** Average std dev ~4.5% vs. ~5.5% for NASDAQ
2. **More Defensive:** Better downside protection in weak years
3. **Dividend Stability:** Many DJIA names provide income buffer

### Key Differences:
- **NASDAQ-100:** Higher risk/higher reward, driven by growth and innovation
- **DJIA:** More stable, value-oriented, defensive characteristics
- **Both show positive seasonality**, but NASDAQ-100 exhibits more dispersion

## Data Quality & Limitations

### Missing Stocks (Failed Downloads)
Several stocks had insufficient history for 2000-2024 period:
- **SGEN, ANSS:** No timezone data (data quality issues)
- **CRWD, ARM, SNOW, PLTR, DASH, ABNB, MNDY, ZM, LCID:** Recent IPOs (2016+)
- **META, TSLA:** Data available from 2012+
- **Many tech IPOs:** Limited to 10-15 years of data

### Survivorship Bias
- Analysis uses **current NASDAQ-100 constituents** only
- Excludes delisted/removed companies (e.g., failed startups)
- Likely **overstates historical returns**

### Data Completeness
- **1,904 observations** from 96 stocks × 25 years
- Expected maximum: 2,400 observations (100%)
- Actual: 79% completeness
- Missing data due to IPO dates and acquisition/delisting events

## Investment Implications

### 1. **Sector Rotation Strategy**
- **Overweight:** Semiconductors (AVGO, AMAT, KLAC), Consumer Discretionary (MNST, ROST, AMZN)
- **Neutral:** Mega-cap tech (AAPL, GOOG), Biotech (ILMN, ALNY)
- **Avoid:** Stocks with win rates <50% or high volatility without compensating returns

### 2. **Risk-Adjusted Approach**
For **conservative investors:**
- Focus on AVGO, AAPL, ASML, GOOG (low volatility, high win rate)
- Target 1.5-2.0% returns with 70%+ win rates

For **aggressive investors:**
- Consider ENPH, PANW, MU, AMD (higher returns, higher volatility)
- Potential 2.5-3.5% returns but accept 50-70% win rates

### 3. **Timing Considerations**
- **Entry:** 3-4 business days before Thanksgiving (typically Monday/Tuesday)
- **Exit:** Black Friday (half-day session, closes 1:00 PM ET) or following Monday
- **Position sizing:** 5-10% portfolio allocation per stock maximum

## Research Questions for Further Analysis

1. **Historical Constituent Analysis:** Did removed NASDAQ-100 stocks show different patterns?
2. **Volatility Regime Dependence:** Does seasonality strengthen in low-VIX environments?
3. **Market Cap Segmentation:** Do small-cap NASDAQ stocks (<$10B) show stronger effects?
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Are semiconductor stocks moving together or independently?
5. **Post-Pandemic Shift:** Has the pattern changed since 2020 (COVID-era)?

---

## Conclusions

1. **Strong Evidence of Thanksgiving Effect:** 80% of analyzed NASDAQ-100 stocks show positive median returns

2. **Semiconductor Sector Leadership:** Chip stocks dominate top performers with 2-3.6% median returns

3. **Consumer Optimism Premium:** Stocks with direct Black Friday exposure (retail, consumer tech) outperform

4. **Technology Concentration Amplifies Effect:** NASDAQ-100's tech bias creates stronger seasonality vs. DJIA

5. **Win Rate vs. Magnitude Trade-off:** 
   - Highest returns: ENPH, PANW (69% win rate)
   - Highest consistency: MNST, ASML (80-84% win rate)

6. **Statistical Robustness:** With 1,904 observations and 25-year history, patterns appear stable

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **For Research and Educational Purposes Only**

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Not financial advice or investment recommendations
