## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Data
- **CRM (Salesforce):** Only 21 years (IPO: 2004)
- **V (Visa):** Only 17 years (IPO: 2008)
- **DOW:** Missing most years (recent DJIA addition)
- **BA (Boeing):** 24 years (1 timeout error)

### Survivorship Considerations
- Analysis uses **current DJIA constituents** (as of November 2025)
- Excludes companies that were removed from the index during 2000-2024 period
- This may introduce positive bias, though magnitude is difficult to quantify without historical constituent data
- Future analyses should consider point-in-time membership for unbiased estimates

### Data Completeness by Universe
- **DJIA:** 718 observations out of 750 possible (96% completeness)
- Highest completeness among the three indices analyzed (vs. S&P 500: 89%, NASDAQ-100: 79%)
- Mature, stable index membership contributes to excellent data coverage

---

## Returns Specification

**Important:** All returns reported in this analysis are **gross returns** (calculated from close-to-close prices without adjustments).

**Gross vs. Net Returns:**
- **Gross returns** = Price change only (Open → Close)
- **Net returns** = Gross returns minus transaction costs

**Transaction costs not included:**
- Bid-ask spreads (typically 0.01-0.05% for liquid DJIA stocks)
- Commissions (varies by broker, often zero for retail traders)
- Market impact for large orders (depends on position size)
- Slippage on market orders

**Implication:** Actual trading returns will be lower than reported gross returns. For small retail positions, the difference is typically minor (0.05-0.15%). For institutional size, costs can be more significant.

## Trading Implications

### Long Candidates (Positive Edge)
- **High Conviction:** AAPL, AMZN, HD (>1.5% median, >68% win rate)
- **Moderate Conviction:** UNH, NKE, VZ (1-1.5% median, >59% win rate)
- **Low Volatility:** MCD, NKE, WMT (stable, consistent)

### Avoid / Short Candidates
- **Negative Edge:** JNJ, JPM, GS, CRM (negative median returns)
- **High Volatility, Low Return:** GS, CRM (poor risk-reward)

### Portfolio Construction
- **Diversified Basket:** Top 10 stocks by median return
- **Risk Management:** Avoid high-volatility financials
- **Sector Tilt:** Overweight technology & consumer discretionary

## Comparison: 5-Year vs 25-Year Results

### Changes in Rankings

| Stock | 5-Yr Rank | 25-Yr Rank | Change |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| BA | 1st | 14th | ↓ 13 |
| CVX | 2nd | 17th | ↓ 15 |
| VZ | 3rd | 6th | ↑ 3 |
| AAPL | - | 1st | New Top |
| AMZN | - | 2nd | New Top |

**Key Observation:** Short-term (5-year) leaders like BA and CVX show regression to the mean over longer periods. Technology stocks (AAPL, AMZN) demonstrate sustained outperformance over 25 years.

## Conclusions

1. **Thanksgiving Effect Exists:** 83% of stocks show positive median returns during the analysis window

2. **Technology Dominance:** Tech sector shows strongest and most consistent performance

3. **Retail Anticipation:** Consumer-facing stocks benefit from Black Friday retail expectations (despite half-day trading session closing at 1:00 PM ET)

4. **Financial Underperformance:** Banks and financial services show weakness during holiday period

5. **Statistical Robustness:** With 25 years of data and 718 observations across 30 stocks, empirical patterns show consistency over multiple economic cycles

6. **Risk Considerations:** 
   - Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
   - Each stock has maximum 25 observations (limited sample size for individual securities)
   - Survivorship bias present (current DJIA constituents only)
   - Gross returns reported; transaction costs will reduce actual net returns
   - Market conditions and participant behavior evolve over time
   - Holiday effect may diminish as more market participants become aware

## Academic Context

This analysis aligns with established literature on calendar anomalies and holiday effects in financial markets:

- **Lakonishok & Smidt (1988)** documented significant positive returns around major US holidays in their 90-year study
- **Ariel (1990)** specifically identified pre-holiday effects including Thanksgiving
- **Brockman & Michayluk (1998)** confirmed persistence of holiday effects through the 1990s

Our findings of 83% positive median returns during the Thanksgiving window are consistent with this academic literature, though readers should note that:
- Some calendar anomalies have diminished after publication (Market efficiency increases)
- Transaction costs and market impact can erode observed patterns
- Statistical significance testing with multiple hypothesis correction is essential

**For complete academic references and methodology, see:** [REFERENCES.md](REFERENCES.md)

## Statistical Notes

**Methodology:**
- **Returns:** Simple returns (not log returns): (Close - Open) / Open
- **Median preferred over mean:** More robust to outliers
- **Win rate:** Percentage of years with positive returns
- **Standard deviation:** Annualized volatility proxy (though based on single observation per year)

**Statistical Significance:**
Future analyses should include:
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for median and mean returns
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-parametric test vs. zero)
- Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing (30 stocks)
- Effect size measures (Cohen's d)
- Sharpe ratio calculations for risk-adjusted assessment

The enhanced analytical framework with these statistical tests is now available in the codebase (see `src/tgalpha/stats_tests.py`).

## Recommendations

**For Researchers:**
- Extend analysis to S&P 500 for broader validation ✅ **(COMPLETED - see ANALYSIS_SP500_25YEARS.md)**
- Test alternative windows (e.g., 5 days before/after, 2 days before/after)
- Analyze sector rotation patterns and factor exposures
- Implement statistical significance testing ✅ **(COMPLETED - see stats_tests.py module)**
- Consider point-in-time index membership to eliminate survivorship bias
- Compare holiday effect across different economic regimes (recession vs. expansion)

**For Traders:**
- **Long candidates (empirical edge):** AAPL, AMZN, HD, UNH, NKE
- **Avoid/short candidates:** JNJ, GS, JPM during this window
- Use appropriate position sizing and risk management
- Account for transaction costs in strategy design (bid-ask spreads, commissions, slippage)
- Consider that reported returns are gross; net returns will be lower
- Be aware of reduced liquidity on Black Friday half-day session (1:00 PM ET close)

**For Portfolio Managers:**
- Tactical tilt toward technology & consumer discretionary
- Reduce financial sector exposure around Thanksgiving
- Consider this as one factor among many in allocation decisions
- Backtest with realistic trading costs and market impact
- Monitor whether effect persists or diminishes over time
- Use statistical significance tests to validate any trading signals
