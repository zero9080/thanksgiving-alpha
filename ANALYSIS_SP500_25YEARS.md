## Data Quality Assessment

### Completeness by Sector
- **Technology:** 85-95% (many recent IPOs)
- **Financials:** 90-95% (stable constituents)
- **Healthcare:** 85-90% (biotech IPOs affect completeness)
- **Consumer:** 90-95% (mature companies)
- **Energy:** 85-90% (sector consolidation impacts)
- **Industrials:** 90-95% (stable membership)

### Known Data Issues
**Missing/Limited History:**
- Recent IPOs: SNOW, PLTR, DASH, ABNB, UBER, LYFT, COIN (2018+)
- Spinoffs: CARR, DOW, CTVA (2019+)
- Timezone errors: BRK.B, HES, MRO, PEAK, SQ (data quality issues)

**Survivorship Bias:**
- Analysis uses **current S&P 500 constituents** (as of November 2025)
- Excludes companies that were removed or delisted during 2000-2024 period
- This may introduce positive bias, though magnitude is difficult to quantify without historical constituent data
- Future analyses should consider point-in-time membership for unbiased estimates

### Data Reliability
- **High confidence:** Stocks with 20+ years (170+ stocks)
- **Moderate confidence:** Stocks with 15-19 years (50+ stocks)
- **Lower confidence:** Stocks with 10-14 years (44 stocks)

## Research Questions for Future Analysis

1. **Historical Reconstitution:** What if we use point-in-time S&P 500 membership?
2. **Factor Analysis:** Which factors (value, growth, momentum, quality) drive outperformance?
3. **Market Cap Segments:** Do small-cap S&P stocks outperform large-caps?
4. **Volatility Regimes:** Does VIX level affect the seasonality strength?
5. **Economic Cycles:** Recession vs. expansion performance differences?
6. **Geographic Exposure:** Do international revenue companies behave differently?
7. **Dividend Stocks:** Do dividend payers show different patterns?
8. **ETF vs. Individual:** Would S&P 500 ETF (SPY) capture the effect?

## Risk Disclosures

⚠️ **Critical Warnings:**

1. **Past Performance ≠ Future Results**
   - Historical patterns may not persist
   - Market structure evolves
   - Participant behavior can change

2. **Survivorship Bias Present**
   - Current constituents only analyzed
   - Failed companies excluded
   - Positive bias present, but magnitude uncertain without historical membership data

3. **Transaction Costs Reduce Returns**  
   **Note: All returns reported are gross returns (close-to-close) and do not account for:**
   - Bid-ask spreads (typically 0.01-0.05% for liquid stocks)
   - Commissions (varies by broker, often zero for retail traders)
   - Market impact for large orders (depends on position size)
   - Actual net returns will be lower after transaction costs

4. **Execution Risk**
   - Holiday liquidity can be reduced
   - Black Friday half-day (1:00 PM close)
   - Slippage on market orders
   - Gap risk over long weekends

5. **Strategy Capacity**
   - Small positions: No material market impact
   - Large positions: Liquidity and market impact become constraints
   - Capacity depends on individual stock liquidity and position sizing
   - Seasonality trades can become crowded
   - Front-running by algorithms
   - Pattern degradation if widely adopted
   - Monitor strategy decay

6. **Market Regime Changes**
   - Post-2020 market structure different
   - Retail participation increased
   - Algorithm prevalence higher
   - COVID impacts unclear long-term
